Nearly 1,300 test Covid positive at Kumbh in 5 days, 14 lakh take part in 3rd shahi snan

HARIDWAR/DEHRADUN: At the Haridwar Maha Kumbh, 1,278 people have tested positive for Covid-19 since April 10, among them 18 seers (nine tested positive on Tuesday and nine earlier), according to chief medical officer (CMO), Haridwar, Dr SK Jha. The figures exclude RT-PCR reports of tests done on Kumbh attendees on April 13 and 14 as those are pending.

Wednesday’s shahi snan saw the lowest footfall among all three shahi snans (the figure was upwards of 30 lakh on each day). Inspector-general of police Sanjay Gunjayal, in charge of the Kumbh, said the low footfall had been a blessing of sorts as crowd management was easier.


According to the state health department data, in Haridwar district, some parts of which come under the Kumbh Mela site, 2,167 have tested positive in the same time period. According to the CMO, since April 10, the health department has conducted a total of 2,28,650 tests at the mela site, including antigen, RT-PCR and TrueNat.

India’s daily Covid cases double in 10 days to just shy of 2 lakh

According to the state health department data, in Haridwar district, some parts of which come under the Kumbh Mela site, 2,167 have tested positive in the same time period. According to the CMO, since April 10, the health department has conducted a total of 2,28,650 tests at the mela site, including antigen, RT-PCR and TrueNat.

The CMO added that tests are being done at Haridwar, Pauri, Dehradun and Tehri. As per directives of the Centre and Uttarakhand high court, a minimum of 50,000 Covid-19 tests need to be done at the Kumbh site every day and pilgrims need to show a negative RT-PCR report to enter mela premises. It’s a different matter that on the ground this is almost impossible to be implemented.


“Compared to the scuffles and stampedes of shahi snans at the earlier Haridwar Kumbhs in 1986, 1998 and 2010, this one was more organized. In the 2010 Kumbh, a total of 1.60 crore pilgrims had descended on Haridwar,” Gunjayal said. He added that security forces were now preparing for the next shahi snan and other events of the Kumbh.
