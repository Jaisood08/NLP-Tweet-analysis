# NLP-Tweet-analysis

This project was made to focus on topic - "Kumbh Mela"
I have taken some positive and negative articles on topic 
and created a dateset of them.
Then i have trained a model on this data.
Finally i am fetching tweets on this topic and analyzing them 
as positive or negative tweets.

This project will
 1.Convert big text files into vectors.
 2.Make a model to detect a positve or negative desicion .
 3.fetch tweets on a particular topic without any api.
 4.analyse them.
